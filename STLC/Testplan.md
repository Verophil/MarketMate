Template Testplan
1. Analyse the Product
   
Objective

The primary objective of the product is to enhance the existing online shopping platform by introducing new features and ensuring the smooth functioning of existing functionalities.

User Base

The product will be used by existing and new customers of the online shopping platform, primarily individuals and families purchasing groceries, household essentials, and pet supplies.

Hardware and Software Specifications

Hardware Requirements:
Devices: PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets
Specifications: Standard configurations for Android and iOS devices, desktops with minimum 4GB RAM, 2GHz processor
Software Requirements:
Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS
Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
Dependencies: Backend services, third-party ad services, payment gateways

Product Functionality
Existing Features
Register and login
Search, filter, and sort products
Add to favourites and basket
Checkout: billing info, shipping address, payment methods
Price calculation

New Features
Product Rating System – Customers can rate products (1–5 stars) and optionally add written feedback.
Age Verification for Alcoholic Products – A modal prompts users to enter their age when accessing alcoholic products; only users 18+ may proceed.
Shipping Cost Changes – Orders above a threshold of 20 € qualify for free shipping; orders below are charged a shipping fee of 5€.

2. Design the Test Strategy
   
In Scope:

- Functional testing of all three new features.
- Regression testing of impacted areas (product detail pages, checkout process, basket calculation).
- Usability testing of the rating system and age verification modal.
- Boundary testing for shipping calculation and age verification
- Integration with existing webshop features (e.g., ensuring product ratings display correctly in product search results)
- Positive and negative test cases (valid and invalid inputs)

Out of Scope:

- Backend database operations not affecting the user interface
- Third party payment services integration
- Cross-browser and device compatibility checks for the new features
- Testing of existing features that have not been modified

Type of Testing:

- Functional Testing – Validate new features against requirements.
- Boundary Value Testing – Especially relevant for age verification and shipping threshold.
- Equivalence Partitioning – For text input in rating feedback and valid/invalid inputs.
- State Transition Testing – For scenarios like re-entering age verification or basket total updates.
- Regression Testing – Ensure existing functionalities are not broken.
- Usability Testing – Ensure smooth and intuitive interaction with new features.

Risks and Issues

Delays in development
Mitigation: Implement a buffer period in the schedule.
Lack of test data
Mitigation: Create mock data sets for testing purposes.
Resource unavailability
Mitigation: Identify backup resources.

Usability: Users can navigate and use the platform easily.

5. Define Test Criteria
   
Suspension Criteria

Testing will be suspended if critical defects are found that block further testing.
Lack of necessary resources or test environment failures.

Exit Criteria

All planned tests have been executed.
Run Rate: At least 95% of all test cases have been executed.
Pass Rate: At least 90% of executed test cases have passed.
All critical and high-priority defects have been resolved and closed.
No severity 1 or severity 2 defects are open.
Performance metrics meet the defined standards.
Security vulnerabilities have been identified and addressed.
User acceptance testing has been completed, and sign-off has been obtained.
